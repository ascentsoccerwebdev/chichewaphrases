          Talent and desire are equally distributed across the globe. Opportunity however, is not.<br>
          Ascent Soccer empowers this undeserved talent and promise of the 'Warm Heart of Africa', as the greenest soccer club and academy on the continent.<br>
          We are a social impact organization that transforms the lives of young men and women in some of Southeast Africa’s poorest countries by providing opportunities for comprehensive education, critical life skills and character development -- combined with world-class soccer skill development.<br>
          Ascent Soccer starts at the grassroots, inspiring and nurturing talented girls and boys in Southeast Africa to be brave, to lead by example and to believe in their ability to transform themselves, their communities and the world.<br>

          We are soccer and scholarship, that puts people and the planet first.<br>
          Adaptavist, as our exclusive 'Scholarship Pillar Partner', is transforming how we deliver education, character and leadership development, and technology. Their financial support is accelerating our impact. Their network is expanding our reach. And, their committed volunteer hours open our scholars' minds to all that's possible through coding and online education.<br>
          Adaptavist is a true partner in Ascent’s vision to guide youth to realize and reach their potential, and allow them to grow into exceptional young men and women who not only re-invest in their own communities, but provide opportunities for the success of future graduates.<br>
